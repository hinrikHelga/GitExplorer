# gitexplorer

## Description

GitExplorer is app that can search in GitHub repositories and show pre-defined characteristics
of a GitHub repository.

## Git branch stategy

All contributions should be developed on a seperate feature or bug branch (feature/_ or bugfix/_) and merged to develop once ready. Develop is then merged to master once all features planned for the release are finished. This ensures the develop branch will never contain uncompileable WIP and reduces the frequency that developers need to merge contributions. This also ensures that master will only contain fully-fledged release version of the app.
